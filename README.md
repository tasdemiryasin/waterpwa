# WaterPWA: Water Tracking Progressive Web App

WaterPWA is a privacy-focused PWA built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It helps users track daily and weekly water consumption, set goals, and receive remindersâ€”all data is stored locally for maximum privacy.

## Features
- **Home Page**: View daily water consumption and increase it with a customizable button.
- **Statistics Page**: See weekly water consumption in a bar chart. Bars turn green when reaching your target, which is shown as a dashed red line.
- **Settings Page**: Set increment amount, target, reminder interval, and reset all data.
- **Reminders**: Get notifications at your chosen interval to drink water.
- **Modern UI**: Minimalist, Apple/Uber-inspired design.
- **Offline-first**: All data is stored locally; minimal network usage after install.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
