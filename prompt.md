You are an expert nextjs developer. Your job is to create a nextjs pwa. 
This pwa will be a water tracking app. It will have three pages: 
-Home page
-Statistics page
-Settings page

The user will see the daily consumption on the home page. Besides
there will be a button to increase the amount of water consumption on that page. 

on the statistics page the user will see the weekly water consumption with bar charts.
the x axis of the chart will show days of the week like monday tuesday etc. 
the y axis of the chart will show the amount of water consumed. 

On the settings page, the user will set the amount the button on the home page to increase. The 
selected amount will also be written on the home page button. Besides the user will decide on the 
target consumption amount. The amount will be shown on the bar chart of the statistics page with a 
dashed red line on the y axis. When the bars on the statistics page reach the dashed line they will change 
their color from blue to green. The settings page will also have a picker which will set the time interval 
user will be reminded to drink water. For example, if the user chooses 10 minutes, the app will send a notification 
to remind the user to drink water every 10 minutes. There will be a reset button to delete all the information. 

The pwa focuses on user privacy, so all the data will be kept locally on the client side. Since this is going to hosted 
on the free tier vercel app hosting, the pwa once downloaded to the phone must make minimal traffic in terms of the requests. 

As for the layout of the application, follow a very modern and minimalist design. Follow the apple human interface design guidelines.
Use a design like ubers.
