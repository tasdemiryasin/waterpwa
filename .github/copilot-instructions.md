This project is a Next.js PWA for water tracking. It uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and stores all data locally for privacy. The app has Home, Statistics, and Settings pages, and follows a modern, minimalist design inspired by Apple and Uber guidelines. All features should be implemented with local storage and minimal network usage after install.
